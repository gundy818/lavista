This is a tool to visualise the network configuration of a linux host. It will be able
to draw what is running with interfaces, bridges, namespaces etc.

Configurations are becoming more complicated with VMs, containers and namespaces, and it
can be hard to figure out what's going on. Hopefully this will help.


== Language

I'll use python just because it's available on everything these days. But you will be
able to dump the data so it can be used with other tools.
